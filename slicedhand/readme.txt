I have to move the 'slicedhand' folder to here(root directory) because with an permission problem in the Google Cloud.
If you are running on a local server, you can have the 'slicedhand' folder inside the Server directory.
Also if you add permission rules to storage bucket, you can have the 'slicedhand' folder under Server directory.
